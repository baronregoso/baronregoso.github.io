		As of now, I may have to go with CMSC 22 since it has given me a glimpse of how powerful java can be when creating certain applications.

	I have previously taken PI 10 last 2nd semester of my first year here in UP. I never really have given much thought about Rizal before taking the said course, but now, it has shown my classmates and I of how relevant our national hero was during his time in the past.

	From my perspective, Python is basically an all around programming language that is easily understandable and powerful due to its syntax and features. It was as if I was merely telling the computer about what it should do in the terminal so yeah, it was fun learning about it.

	My all time favorite and comfort food is Tocino, especially that from Pampanga's Best. Here in elbi, I always crave for the Dinakdakan and Ginataang Kalabasa at Anie's Carinderia near 7/11 Agapita.
